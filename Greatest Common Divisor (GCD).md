The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD), also known as the Greatest Common Factor (GCF) or Highest Common Factor (HCF), is a fundamental concept in number theory and mathematics. It represents the largest positive integer that divides two or more numbers without leaving a remainder. In other words, it is the largest common factor of two or more integers.

Here's a description of the GCD:

1. **Definition**: The GCD of two or more integers is the largest positive integer that divides each of them without leaving a remainder. For example, the GCD of 12 and 18 is 6 because 6 is the largest number that can evenly divide both 12 and 18.

2. **Notation**: The GCD of two numbers "a" and "b" is often denoted as GCD(a, b) or (a, b).

3. **Properties**:
   - The GCD is always a positive integer.
   - If the GCD of two numbers is 1, they are said to be relatively prime or coprime, meaning they have no common factors other than 1.
   - If one of the numbers is a multiple of the other, their GCD is the smaller number. For example, GCD(15, 75) = 15.
   - If one or both of the numbers are zero, the GCD is defined to be the absolute value of the other number. For example, GCD(0, 7) = 7.

4. **Calculation**: There are several methods to calculate the GCD:
   - **Euclidean Algorithm**: This is one of the most commonly used methods to find the GCD of two numbers. It involves iteratively applying the division remainder until the remainder becomes zero. The GCD is then the last non-zero remainder. This method is efficient and widely used in computer algorithms.
   - **Prime Factorization**: Another method is to find the prime factorization of both numbers and then determine the common prime factors. The GCD is the product of these common prime factors.
   - **Using a Recursive Function**: You can calculate the GCD recursively by repeatedly applying the rule GCD(a, b) = GCD(b, a % b) until b becomes zero.

5. **Applications**:
   - The GCD is used in various mathematical and engineering calculations, such as simplifying fractions, finding equivalent fractions, and solving Diophantine equations.
   - In computer science, the GCD is used in algorithms like the Extended Euclidean Algorithm for solving linear Diophantine equations and modular arithmetic problems.
   - It plays a crucial role in cryptography, particularly in algorithms involving modular arithmetic, such as RSA encryption.

Understanding the GCD is essential in various mathematical and computational contexts, and it has wide-ranging applications in solving problems related to numbers and their relationships.


C Code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to calculate the GCD of two numbers
int gcd(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0) {
        return a;
    } else {
        return gcd(b, a % b);
    }
}

int main() {
    int num1, num2;

    printf("Enter two numbers: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &num1, &num2);

    // Ensure both numbers are non-negative
    if (num1 < 0 || num2 < 0) {
        printf("Please enter non-negative numbers.\n");
        return 1; // Exit with an error code
    }

    // Calculate the GCD
    int result = gcd(num1, num2);

    printf("GCD of %d and %d is %d\n", num1, num2, result);

    return 0;
}
```
